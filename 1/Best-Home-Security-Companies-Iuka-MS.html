<p>Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are ending up being an increasingly more prevalent feature of American life. Worries of terrorism and the accessibility of ever-cheaper cameras have actually sped up the trend a lot more.

However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level.
