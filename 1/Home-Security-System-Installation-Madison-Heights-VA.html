<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
