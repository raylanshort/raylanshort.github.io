In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

If someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.
