As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
