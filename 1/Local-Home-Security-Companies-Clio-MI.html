That being stated, bullet cameras are more vulnerable to vandalism because of their apparent appearance. Furthermore, the shape of the camera is perfect for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but requires multiple cameras if a user requires to see numerous fixed views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work inside or outdoors. They feature a small lip on the end of the camera that includes weather condition protection and decreases glare.</p>
