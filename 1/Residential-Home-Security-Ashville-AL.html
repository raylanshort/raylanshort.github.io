After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of up to one year of battery life.

<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
