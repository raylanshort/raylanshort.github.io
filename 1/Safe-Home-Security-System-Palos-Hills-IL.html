For instance, if a motion detector journeys in one location, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- received in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to ask for a dispatch instantly. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe need to a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
