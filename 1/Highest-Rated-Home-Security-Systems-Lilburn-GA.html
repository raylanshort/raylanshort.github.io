<h3>Wireless House Alarm in Lilburn GA</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control panel (generally positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been triggered, wise alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've already left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been triggered, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly irritating your neighbours).
