<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating sophisticated smart home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, including creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is costly, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also expensive if you don't dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
