<h3>Security Surveillance Cameras in Mount Vernon MO</h3>

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
