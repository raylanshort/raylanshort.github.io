When the change in field strength weakens due to the presence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is concealed after installation.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers totally free benefits like individual detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked only about half of the time and the camera regularly disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, as well as when we made modifications in the settings.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
