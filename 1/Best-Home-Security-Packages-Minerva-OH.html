<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
