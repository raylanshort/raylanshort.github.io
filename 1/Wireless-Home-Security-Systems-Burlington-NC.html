<p>We looked for Do It Yourself systems that offered professional monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies supply complimentary or heavily affordable hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some people may want to register for service just for when they or their partner is out of town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you utilize, as well as how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>
