<h3>Monitored Home Security Systems in Arizona</h3>
<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month.

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to use as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though.
