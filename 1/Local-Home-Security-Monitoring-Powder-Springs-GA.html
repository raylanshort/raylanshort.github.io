<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
