<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less robberies throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and inefficient  approach to robbery reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>

As a former editor for Electronic House and Broad View Big Noise, I have actually written purchasing guides for numerous consumer-electronics items, and I have actually written short articles covering technology for The New York Times (which is now Wirecutter's parent company), Wired, Lady's Day, Guy's Health, and other publications.</p>
