The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
