<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the producer's stats since this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>Perhaps you have kids and need to include cameras to the nursery. As your kids grow, it's easy to develop out your system by including cameras in any areas where your kids need monitoring. That's just $1.25 a day (or about $38 a month) for all of your Ring Alarm equipment, a Ring Video Doorbell, and a whole year of expert monitoring. Disaster protection - you can connect a z-wave smoke and carbon monoxide gas alarm to the app. Downside: some systems have a high rate of incorrect alarms due to the fact that some of these sensing units might be too delicate. Although systems using DSP (digital signal processing) will mostly eliminate incorrect alarms on some cases.</p>
<p>If you require high speed recording, choose IP camera. In my view it is the very best security system with low cost of ownership. CCTV systems are complex.
