Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
