Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
