<p>Thanks to current advancements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you've made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you ought to think about the following benefits of wireless technology. For some, that might be worth the $300 price tag.

With conventional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local viewing from one central monitoring area. However that does not indicate you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment.
