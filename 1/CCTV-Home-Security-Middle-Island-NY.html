<h2>Focus On What Matters Most Middle Island</h2>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur regularly enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>

(We think this is a better feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where automobiles frequently pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
