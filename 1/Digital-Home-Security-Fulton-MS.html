Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
