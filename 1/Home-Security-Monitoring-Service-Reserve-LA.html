<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically turn off the heating systems. You can automatically make the clever lights turn on to frighten away potential intruders if the motion sensing units are set off.</p>
