<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas.

As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
