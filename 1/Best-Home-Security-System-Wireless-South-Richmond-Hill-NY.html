<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a typical camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to solve detail after the truth, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of tape-recording storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is really excellent. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
