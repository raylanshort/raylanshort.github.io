Features 1080p HD camera with night vision. Something we truly liked was the customer-friendly policies-- like the life time guarantee on items and the rate-lock guarantee for life. This reveals us that the company truly appreciates its users. Aside from perhaps Frontpoint or ADT, we usually do not see this with most companies.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe has a better-looking system than Ring, with voice prompts and assistance for Google Assistant in addition to Amazon Alexa (but not Apple HomeKit). It also has add-ons such as a video camera, a doorbell camera, smoke alarms, and additional sensors. Unlike the Ring Alarm, however, it does not offer self-monitoring options or outdoor cameras; you also can't include any non-SimpliSafe gadgets, and live customer support is offered only from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. Eastern.</p>

<p>There's a ton more we could say about the Arlo Ultra, but for now we'll point out simply one more thing: color night vision. Invite to the future.
