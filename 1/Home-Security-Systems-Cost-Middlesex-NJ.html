When we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we tilted the entire collection external for another two weeks to see what sort of results we would get when the cameras faced your house across the street, which is approximately 50 feet away.</p>

<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police action to alarmed properties) a costly and ineffective  method to break-in decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
