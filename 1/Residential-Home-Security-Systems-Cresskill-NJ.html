<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
