<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the precise very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
