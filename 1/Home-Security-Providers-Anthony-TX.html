As with their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras link to your Wi-Fi network and enable you to view live video from your phone. They are relatively easy to install, but if you're not familiar or comfy with electrical wiring, you might wish to have a professional electrician do the job.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
