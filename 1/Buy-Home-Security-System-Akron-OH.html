<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their portability, impermanence and expandability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, typically avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other components can easily be established at various homes later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new components too.
