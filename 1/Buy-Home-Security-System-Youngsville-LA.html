<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
