I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for instance.

<p>I've covered consumer electronic devices for more than 15 years and have actually evaluated ratings of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
