Don't write off wireless systems based just on the added security risks. It's not an unsolvable problem," says Du. Homeowners just need to be knowledgeable about the risks so they can avoid undesirable security breaches.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
