<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. With decades of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle homes and companies, we have actually developed great relationships with both local police forces and their clients. Also, do not forget that your wireless network security can be in some cases weak, and vulnerable to exploits.

Aside from security, Outright Security Alarms has home automation items and options. 2GIG's control board can speak and control basic home automation items like door locks, lighting, thermostats, and small device modules.</p>
<p>A good home security system is able to monitor the entry indicate your home, such as windows and doors, search for motion inside your home, sound a loud alarm, and have the ability to call authorities if you're not home and the alarm is set off.

There is a 30-day threat complimentary return offer, in addition to a 2-year warranty. While these are clearly sensible prices, some care is needed.

Keep in mind also that these have all included a longer-term legal tie-in and some relatively extreme early termination charges. So, be sure you know what you're getting into prior to you sign the dotted line.</p>
<p>Blue by ADT security systems begin around $200 for equipment. You can select from a fixed equipment package or curate your own setup to match your security needs. Motion Detection: If you're concerned about video storage, check to see if the camera provides motion detection. The camera will just record when it senses motion, conserving you storage space and time searching unneeded video footage. ADT uses both landline and cellular monitoring. Landline monitoring might appear old-fashioned, but if you do not have reputable cell service in your location, it's the best alternative. At $36.99, ADT is one of the more expensive alternatives for landline monitoring.</p>
<p>Very simply, the individual at the door presses the button. You'll get an alert to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you want a doorbell sound too.) The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Show, if you have one of those) - and since it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the individual at the door if you so dream. Useful if, for example, it's the postman and you're out. You can advise him or her where to leave the products.</p>
