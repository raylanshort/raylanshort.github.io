Where some options, like ADT, have good equipment however so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have a few of the very best functions on the marketplace, including video analytics and 4K image sensors (in addition to more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
