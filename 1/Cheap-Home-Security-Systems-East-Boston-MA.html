<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
