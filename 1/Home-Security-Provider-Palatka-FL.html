<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police ability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers support cops response to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive technique to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
