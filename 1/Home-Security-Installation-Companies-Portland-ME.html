<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
