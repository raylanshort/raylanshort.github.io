Not only is the Arlo quick to select moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years earlier, the home security industry was controlled by a few huge names using costly, rigid plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-lasting contracts.

Although our testing shouldn't be taken as conclusive, we believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe consumers who own the present system.</p>
