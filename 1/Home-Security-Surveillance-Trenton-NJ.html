In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>
