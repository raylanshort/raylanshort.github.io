As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
