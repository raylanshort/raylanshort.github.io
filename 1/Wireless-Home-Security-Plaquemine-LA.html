The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some challenging effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
