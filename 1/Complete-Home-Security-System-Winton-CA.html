<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make customers stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that can finding tiny differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon details about the temperature level differences.
