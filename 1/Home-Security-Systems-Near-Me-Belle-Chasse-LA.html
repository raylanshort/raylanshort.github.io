<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, portability and impermanence.

Wireless control panels, sensing units and other elements can easily be established at various homes later, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new components too. Wireless security strategies likewise allow remote control of the system and general home automation.
