<p>Depending upon the zone activated, number and series of zones, time of day, and other elements, the alarm monitoring center may automatically start different actions. Central station operators may be instructed to call emergency services right away, or to first call the safeguarded premises or property manager to attempt to identify if the alarm is authentic. Operators might likewise begin calling a list of contact number provided by the consumer to call somebody to go check on the secured premises. Some zones might trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go check on the system, or a call to the owner with details of which space may be getting flooded.

(We think this is a better feature if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Camera.</p>
