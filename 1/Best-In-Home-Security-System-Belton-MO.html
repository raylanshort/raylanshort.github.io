<p>The Douglas County Burglar Alarm Ordinance supplies a fair solution to a difficult issue: handling our law enforcement assets to offer exceptional law enforcement services.

<p>At night, though it lacks the complete IR LED variety of some competitors, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not just is the Arlo fast to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Simply a couple years back, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of big names using costly, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors linked to a keypad control board and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has all altered.</p>
