We love that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need numerous Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get costly. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
