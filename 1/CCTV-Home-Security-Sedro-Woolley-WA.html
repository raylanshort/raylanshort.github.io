As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might discover to be careful about the books and regulars they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers."
