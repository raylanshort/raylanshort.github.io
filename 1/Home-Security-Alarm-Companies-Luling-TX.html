Vivint's other gadgets such as sensors and outdoor and doorbell cameras are equally high-end and compatible with 3rd party wise home devices.

We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
