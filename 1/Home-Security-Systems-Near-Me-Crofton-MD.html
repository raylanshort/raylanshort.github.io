<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative smart home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some challenging effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
