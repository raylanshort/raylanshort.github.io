The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four totally free false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>Given that Seattle's incorrect alarm charges are so high for alarm companies, Frontpoint also uses validated reaction services.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions.
