Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
