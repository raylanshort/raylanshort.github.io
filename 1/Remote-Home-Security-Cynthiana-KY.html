<p>Commercial residential or commercial properties tend to have even greater incorrect alarm rates than houses due to the fact that more individuals tend to share duty for activating and shutting down the alarm, and the systems tend to be more intricate. The rate of incorrect alarms for commercial alarm users may be as much as three times higher than the rate of incorrect alarms amongst residential alarm users. 9 Chronic incorrect alarm activations are frequently due to insufficient staff member training or inferior systems that have not been updated.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
