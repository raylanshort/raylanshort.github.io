<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the producer's statistics given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for brief battery life by far.

<p>Analog high definition cameras are a terrific option for businesses to update from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired using coax cable or CAT-5 cable. AHD cameras use the exact same RG59 or RG6 cable television as conventional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can also be used. While professional monitoring expenses more, it's more secure. When something activates your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and then notify the authorities for you. Seems like a safer bet to us.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
