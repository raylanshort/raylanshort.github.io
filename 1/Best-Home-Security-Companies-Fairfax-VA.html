This permits you to have a record of events and can help aid law enforcement in the event of a burglary or vandalism. A closed-circuit is the most typical, and when an electric current is continuously running around the perimeter of the home, breaking the circuit - by opening a door or window - cuts off the electric current.

Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
