<p>Canary has overcome some initial software application problems to use a really good security camera option: especially that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of view, night vision and motion signals (plus clear audio).

<p>The real reason cameras are usually released is to lower much pettier criminal activities. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the concern have found that they have not minimized crime. "Once the crime and offence figures were adapted to take account of the basic down trend in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in certain categories but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually minimized criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the maker's statistics because this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for short battery life by far.
