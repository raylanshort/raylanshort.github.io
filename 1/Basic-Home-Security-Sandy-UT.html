<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should shoulder a share of the cost.

Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and whole communities (all taxpayers support authorities reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a expensive and inefficient  technique to burglary reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
