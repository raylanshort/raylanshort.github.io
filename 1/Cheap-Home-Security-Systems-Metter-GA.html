As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
