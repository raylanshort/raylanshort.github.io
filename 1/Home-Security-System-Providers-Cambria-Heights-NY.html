<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cables. DVR systems are hard to scale up since as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to buy a completely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the connected cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
