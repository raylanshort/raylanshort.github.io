<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
