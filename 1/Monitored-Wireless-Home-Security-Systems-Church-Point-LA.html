<p>A lot of security cameras can be used both inside your home and outdoors. They generally have the same functions like night vision or remote viewing, however they vary in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and in some cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives since their style allows for minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is better to have actually a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection.

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.
