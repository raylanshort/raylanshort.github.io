Because contract-based security systems usually don't included upfront costs. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts!

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
