<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.
