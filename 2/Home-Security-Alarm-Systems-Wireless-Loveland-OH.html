<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider area and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by.
