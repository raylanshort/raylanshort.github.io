Some alarm systems utilize real-time audio and video monitoring technology to verify the legitimacy of an alarm.

<h2>Buy Wireless CCTV Camera Online At Best Prices Bellville</h2>
<p>Think about it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It just does not add up. To use such low prices, producers need to cut corners, and completion outcome is jeopardized efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in ideal conditions like brilliant sunlight?

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
