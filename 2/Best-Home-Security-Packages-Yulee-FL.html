<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
