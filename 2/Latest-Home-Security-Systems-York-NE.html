<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
