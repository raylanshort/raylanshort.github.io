<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems intended to summon police department workers, requires registration, evaluation of costs for extreme false burglar alarms, provides treatments for repeat transgressors, and offers an effective date. While some vestiges of the old market remain, today's property owners exist with a lot more alternatives. Wireless innovation and home automation features have boosted the strength of home security, while giving consumers unprecedented control and customizability over their equipment.

Which security cameras are right for your system depends upon your private needs and budget; are you placing them inside or outdoors? Is 1080P a big enough resolution? Will they be able to see and tape-record video effectively in low-lighting? Are they positioned with sufficient field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be needed? When choosing security cameras for your CCTV system, these are all essential questions to be thought about.</p>
