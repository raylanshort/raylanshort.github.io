<p>If you have an interest in a 4K camera system, you preferably will have an extremely high-speed Internet connection and a robust home network, preferably an enterprise-grade network. As gone over above, the 4K camera images are large, which is a lot of data to boss around the home's network and optionally, to an offsite cloud recording service (more on that listed below). Rely on your HTA Licensed technology expert for advice here, as they will have the ability to identify if a 4K camera system will work in your situation.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
