Although robbery remains among the most often reported criminal offenses, the clearance rate for U.S. robberies has remained below 15 percent for many years. 14 Clearly, whatever contribution burglar alarms are making to fixing robbery cases is modest, at best.

<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute considerably to police ability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers fund authorities reaction to alarmed properties) a inefficient and costly technique to break-in decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
