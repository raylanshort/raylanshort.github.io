<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, because it is instead linked straight to a network.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
