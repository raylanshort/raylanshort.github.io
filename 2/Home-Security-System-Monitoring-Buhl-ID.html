<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal activity prevention created to prevent both individual and residential or commercial property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will reduce criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other nearby areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
