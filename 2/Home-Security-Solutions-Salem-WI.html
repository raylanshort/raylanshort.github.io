This indicates that you have to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your property is larger than 4,500 square feet.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
