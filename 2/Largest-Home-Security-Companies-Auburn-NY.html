<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide simple Do It Yourself installation, other companies use (and sometimes need) expert installation. Professional installation is readily available for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Remember that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a quite standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>As soon as the alarm company agent has actually made an appraisal of your security needs, ask him for a composed proposition and a copy of the contract you will need to sign.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
