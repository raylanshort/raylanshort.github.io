As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
