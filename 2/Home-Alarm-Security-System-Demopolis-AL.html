Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
