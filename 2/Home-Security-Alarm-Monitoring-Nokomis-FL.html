<p>so state you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I suggest to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras present an apparent sign for anyone who goes by that they are being recorded on CCTV and this can be an excellent deterrent of theft and crime.
