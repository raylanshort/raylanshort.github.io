Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
