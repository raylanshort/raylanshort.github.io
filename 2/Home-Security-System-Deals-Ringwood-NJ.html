<p>Dome Cameras - discrete and vandal-proof cameras with a wider viewing angle, ideal for inside or outside your home. Increasing release of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Lots of websites requiring alarm setups no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer ability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.

Couple of companies have a larger series of equipment or bigger security network offered.</p>
