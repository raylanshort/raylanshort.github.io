<p>Alarm monitoring becomes part of a complete home security system.

For instance, if a motion detector journeys in one location, the signal is tape-recorded and the central-station monitor notifies the customer. A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in a surrounding zone within a brief time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to ask for a dispatch instantly.
