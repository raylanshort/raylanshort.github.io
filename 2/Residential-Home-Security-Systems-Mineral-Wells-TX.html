<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
