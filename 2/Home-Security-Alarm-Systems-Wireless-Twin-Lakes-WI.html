<p>Unmonitored alarm systems do not link to expert monitoring. Rather, they sound an alarm to let you understand there is an issue and then allows you to act.

Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011).
