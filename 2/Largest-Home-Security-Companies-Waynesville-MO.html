CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity prevention method, which argues that chances to offend can be reduced by altering a range of systems such as increasing the danger of a culprit being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, reducing rewards from criminal activity commission, and lowering provocations that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the culprit must be aware of the included surveillance for it to achieve its preferred effect.</p>
