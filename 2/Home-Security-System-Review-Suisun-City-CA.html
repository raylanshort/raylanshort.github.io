You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people might find out to be careful about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts."
