If the system was not installed throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up might require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and gaining access to challenging spots that are sealed in basements or attics. Wired security systems are likewise vulnerable to power failures. Many will have a backup battery system that turns on in the event of an outage, however long term interruptions will lead to the system losing power. When picking a wired system, it's also essential to think about how long you plan to stay at the same residence.
