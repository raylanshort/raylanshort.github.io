<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
