The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.

We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, therefore we may revisit this evaluation. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud.

To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a web browser link on your computer.</p>
