Those are different services with different requirements and goals.</p>

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split.

The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
