<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>

The alarm system does not consist of a wifi security camera but you can purchase a variety of different Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional bonus. There's no external monitoring alternative with this alarm.</p>
