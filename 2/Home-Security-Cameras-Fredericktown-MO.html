<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
