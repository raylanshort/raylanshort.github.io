In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power.</p>
