<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make customers stick with them longer, because switching monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>Some alarm systems are geared up with infrared sensors that can discover and disregard animals under 40 pounds or so. Having a pet-friendly alarm will help prevent incorrect alarms.
