For years, Macs were thought to be immune to viruses and were hardly ever targeted by cybercriminals because they represented such a small portion of the individual computing world compared to countless Windows users.

Sophos Home takes the stress of security with automatic updates, effective Mac anti-viruses, and real-time protection from the current malware and ransomware attacks.

The majority of web connected security systems feature a battery backup, which means if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a restricted amount of time. But, if your web goes down, regrettably, you will lack an alarm until it comes back up.</p>
