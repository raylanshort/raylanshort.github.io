As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people might learn to be mindful about the regulars and books they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers.
