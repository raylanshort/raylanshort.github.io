Aspects we considered included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), exists a monitoring strategy, can window sensors and door sensors be integrated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it deal with your door locks and can it be integrated into an existing wise home setup, consisting of with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
