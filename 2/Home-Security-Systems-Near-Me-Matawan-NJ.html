IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
