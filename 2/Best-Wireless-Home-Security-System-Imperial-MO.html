<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
