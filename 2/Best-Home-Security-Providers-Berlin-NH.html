<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
