Elements we considered consisted of the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring strategy, can window sensing units and door sensing units be integrated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it deal with your door locks and can it be included into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands by means of Amazon Alexa.</p>

A great deal of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as basic as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
