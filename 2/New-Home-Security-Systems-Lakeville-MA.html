<p>Nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. Audio and video verification methods use cameras and microphones to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image pictures. The source audio and video streams are sent out over an interaction link, usually an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the main station where displays recover the images through exclusive software application. The details is then relayed to police and tape-recorded to an event file, which can be used to plan a more strategical and tactical method of a home, and later as prosecution evidence.</p>
<p>Basically, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensing units, cameras, and numerous detectors all connected to a main control board through radio signals.

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they occur often enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
