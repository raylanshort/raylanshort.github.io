<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. Since it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
