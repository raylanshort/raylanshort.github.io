<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
