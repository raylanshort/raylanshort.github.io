<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
