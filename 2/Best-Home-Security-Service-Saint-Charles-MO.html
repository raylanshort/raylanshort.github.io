<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we evaluated, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our screening. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
