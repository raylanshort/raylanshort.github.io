Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the very same subscription model and exact same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, however it includes more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking feature (which follows an individual around the seeing location), much better audio, a more powerful mount, and a larger operating temperature level variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).
