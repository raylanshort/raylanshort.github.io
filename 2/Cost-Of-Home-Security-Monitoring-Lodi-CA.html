<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, others, and centers. Some people might state that we need to not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They claim that they attack personal privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are indicated to keep you and other residential or commercial property safe, not to stalk you.

<p>Depending on the size, these can be anywhere from a rifle bullet or a lipstick tube to a bread loaf, but the basic gist is the very same in every case. They're direct security cameras that install to your wall or ceiling with a tri-axis mount (so do not fret about orienting them while you're screwing them into the wall) and focus on a specific part of your premises. Offered their tubular style, they have room for night-vision and IR functions, and they have much better range and zoom capabilities than the flatter dome security cameras.</p>
