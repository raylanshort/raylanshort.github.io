In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR.

Also, the wired variation typically left spaces of as much as 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery variation left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also lack person detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to cut down on incorrect alerts.</p>
