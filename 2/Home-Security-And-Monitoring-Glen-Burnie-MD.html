<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
