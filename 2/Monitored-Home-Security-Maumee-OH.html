<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
