Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's bathroom. If a patient is having problem, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is normally open or usually closed.
