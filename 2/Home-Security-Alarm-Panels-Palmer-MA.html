<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
