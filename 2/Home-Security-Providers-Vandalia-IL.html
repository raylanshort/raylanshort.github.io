Some alarm companies purposely program communication hold-ups into their home alarm system. These delays, which can be as long as 4 minutes, are installed to reduce false alarms. Our systems are configured so that we receive your alarm signal right away.</p>
<p>We discovered their cellular monitoring to be responsive and reliable, but it was absolutely nothing worth composing home about.

<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it enables you to manage almost every element of the security system from another location, and it's highly adjustable.
