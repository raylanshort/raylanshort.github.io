As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
