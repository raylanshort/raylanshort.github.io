<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the entire neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to keep and how long you plan to keep documented video. The video is going to consume up storage area rapidly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is super reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control panel (typically positioned in the entryway hall) that is utilized to disarm the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have been set off, wise alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly irritating your neighbours).

A great deal of smart cameras can be configured to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives simpler and Hive's ecosystem measures up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
