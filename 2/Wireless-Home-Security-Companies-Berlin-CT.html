The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
