<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible culprits are less most likely to commit criminal offense if they think they are being seen or have a greater risk of being collared. This is also referred to as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Good picture and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stand apart too much. Pretty easy to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from far from your home.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
