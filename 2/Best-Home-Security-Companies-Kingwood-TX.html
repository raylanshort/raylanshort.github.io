<p>Burglar alarms have actually become basic equipment in shops and other organisations, and they're becoming progressively common in personal homes as well. Life can get stressful in some cases, and it can be hard tracking whatever around you. Thankfully, a surveillance camera can provide an extra set of eyes and serve as lookout for you and your household. Surveillance cameras are cameras used to tape the activity of the environment in which they are positioned, normally for use in combination with security steps.

Not only is the Arlo quick to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Just a couple years earlier, the home security industry was dominated by a few big names offering costly, stiff plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-term contracts.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal performance.

A wireless bridge is a fantastic option for long range situations where poles and trees are not present.</p>
