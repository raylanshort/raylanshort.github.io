<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
