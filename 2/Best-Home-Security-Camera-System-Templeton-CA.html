<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling.

You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might learn to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, druggies or members." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people considered to be "out of time and place" with the environments underwent prolonged surveillance.</p>
