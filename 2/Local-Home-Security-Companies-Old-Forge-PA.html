<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
