<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities action to alarmed homes) a inefficient and costly method to burglary decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
