<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
