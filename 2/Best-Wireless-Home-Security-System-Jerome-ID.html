<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide simple Do It Yourself installation, other companies use (and in some cases require) professional installation. Professional installation is available for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>External monitoring service - Some wise alarms come with an optional subscription service that will monitor your home alarm and call the emergency services if it activates and you don't disarm it. Prices range from ₤ 8 to ₤ 19.99 per month. Brinks security serves more than a million families in the United States and Canada. They used to concentrate on hardwired alarm and now focus on wire-free security. Brinks has actually been rated the # 1 home security company for customer satisfaction by J.D. Powers.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
