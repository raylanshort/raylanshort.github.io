<p>Canary has actually got over some preliminary software application concerns to use an extremely decent security camera option: specifically that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of vision, night vision and motion notifies (plus clear audio). What's more, that 90+ decibel siren makes it more of a severe security camera than some others here (though it requires to be by hand activated when you spot something wrong).
