<p>While every house owner frets about break-ins, suspicion has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically resulting in incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a free smart device app that allows citizens who see something suspicious to take a photo and rapidly send it to public safety officials. For example, a public transit rider may see someone behaving suspiciously. Lots of people are messing, texting or surfing with their mobile devices.

Reports from cellphone users can be quickly reviewed and acted on by Public Safety officials.</p>

ADT offers exceptional brand recognition (a powerful criminal offense deterrent), Vivint aces home automation, and Frontpoint uses a high-support alternative for those who want a structured, Do It Yourself system.</p>

The alarm doesn't consist of a wifi security camera but you can buy a number of various Yale cameras that will work with the alarm as optional bonus.
