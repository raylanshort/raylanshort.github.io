<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their expandability, portability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike house owners, normally prevent making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other components can easily be established at various homes in the future, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
