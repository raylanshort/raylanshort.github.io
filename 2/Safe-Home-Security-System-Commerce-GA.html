<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
