<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and scams. Idea: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating expensive false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately turn off the heater. You can instantly make the wise lights turn on to scare away possible burglars if the motion sensors are triggered.</p>
<p>Depending upon the zone triggered, number and series of zones, time of day, and other factors, the alarm monitoring center may automatically start numerous actions. Central station operators might be instructed to call emergency services immediately, or to first call the safeguarded properties or residential or commercial property manager to try to figure out if the alarm is real. Operators might also start calling a list of phone numbers offered by the consumer to call someone to go check on the secured facilities. Some zones might set off a call to the local heating oil company to go look at the system, or a call to the owner with information of which room might be getting flooded. Some alarm are tied to video surveillance systems so that present video of the intrusion area can be quickly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention tape-recorded.</p>
