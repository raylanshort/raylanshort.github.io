<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.
