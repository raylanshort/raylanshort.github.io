<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you watch out for potential bundle thieves or talk to visitors who come by.</p>
