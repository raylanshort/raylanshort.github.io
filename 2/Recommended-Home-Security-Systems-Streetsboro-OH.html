The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might revisit this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of video to the cloud.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions.
