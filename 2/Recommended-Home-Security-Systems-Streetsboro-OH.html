The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might revisit this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of video to the cloud.
